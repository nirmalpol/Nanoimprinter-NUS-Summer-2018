# Nanoimprinter-NUS-Summer-2018

  This respository contains the improvements, changes, additions and tests performed on the Nanoimprinting Lithography device prototype (nanoimprinter) for the National University of Singapore from the duration of May 21, 2018 to July 27, 2018. The nanoimprinter is designed to replicate a mold containing nanochannels onto a new polymer through the use of heat and pressure. The polymer is placed inside the nanoimprinter and the mold is then placed on top of it after which it will be heated and pressurized. The temperatures can rise up to approximately 150Â°C and pressurize to a maximum value of 35 bar.
  
  The "Nanoimprinter Code July 19, 2018" contains the UI code, pressure system code(ADC, DAC), and the temperature system code (Thermocouples, Heating elements).
